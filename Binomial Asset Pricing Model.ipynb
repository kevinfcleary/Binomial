    "We want to implement the Binomial Asset Pricing Model and use it to price derivative securities. We will employ two methods: the first is a Monte Carlo method in which we compute the risk neutral probabilities and then generate one random path, and compute its discounted price. The second is to implement a binomial tree, compute the value of the option at expiry, and then use that information to work backwards up the tree to arrive at the present value of the option. The MC method both in implementation and precision gives a quick and dirty answer, it is easy to write the code, and for moderate trial sizes is very quick, however the answers, as with all MC based methods have high accuracy, low precision. The binomial tree implementation is a bit more involved, but gives exact answers, and for modest tree sizes is not much slower than the MC method, but is much more precise."
